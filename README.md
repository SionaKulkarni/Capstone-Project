Product Inventory Management System

*Abstract
In the fast-paced world of retail and business management, maintaining an efficient and organized inventory is crucial. The Product Inventory Management System is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed using Angular for the front-end and a JSON server for the back-end. This system empowers businesses by streamlining inventory tracking, product categorization, and stock management.

The solution enables users to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring seamless product handling. Additionally, administrators can securely log in, manage inventory, and monitor stock levels in real-time, making it an effective tool for modern businesses.

-Add, update, delete, and list products
-Organize products by categories
-Update stock quantities
-Manage product details such as descriptions, prices, and manufacturers
-Enable secure administrator login for controlled access

With this system, businesses can enhance operational efficiency, reduce manual errors, and optimize inventory handling.
