<h2>About This Application</h2>
<p>The Product Inventory Management System is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using Angular for the front-end and a JSON server for the back-end, designed to streamline inventory management for businesses. It allows users to add, update, delete, and list products, categorize items, manage stock levels, and store product details such as descriptions, prices, and manufacturers. The system includes user authentication, ensuring that only registered users can modify inventory, while administrators have full control. Featuring a responsive UI, search functionality, and form validations, the application enhances efficiency by reducing manual errors and optimizing inventory tracking. Additionally, it ensures smooth navigation with multiple routes, including a welcome page, product listing, about page, sign-in, and register options. Data is stored in db.json, and the system enforces error handling, real-time updates, and proper access controls, making it an effective solution for businesses looking to digitize their inventory processes.</p>
